# Simple Library Project

## presentation

The UI is self-explannatory, you have a form to add books, and a button attached to every book to remove it.

## What I learned:

- how to create html elements (DOM nodes) from html templates (\<template\>)
- linking state to DOM isn't something easy, the more intertwined and complex the project becomes, the more overhead you have to bear to make the simplest of things, one might even say that the growth of complexity is exponential.
